Manuscript Submission Tracker

will track : 
At a minimum, you need to track the following for each of your stories: 

* Market where story is currently submitted: Obvious, yes, but as you begin to have more stories circulating, this becomes harder to track. Aside from knowing Story X is at Market A (and therefore can't be submitted elsewhere), you also need to know you can't submit another story to Market A until they respond to Story X. 

* Date of submission: This lets you send the editor at Market A a polite query if you haven't heard back in a reasonable time on Story X. What's reasonable? I deal with that later in this chapter. Also, for income tax purposes, you must be able to show you are actively pursuing income from writing, which means being able produce a list of annual submissions. 

* Markets that have already rejected this story: When Market A rejects Story X, you want to know where you can send it next, which can't be to a market that's already bounced the story. 

* Date of rejection from each market: Again, you need this to support income tax claims. My system also uses this to calculate the average response time for markets where I've submitted, so I know when to query about a submission if they are on average much faster or slower than three months.

* Market(s) that bought this story: Yes, you will eventually sell your story. I pluralize markets because, in Section Four, you'll learn how to sell reprints and other rights and will need to track multiple markets where a story has appeared. 

* Date of story sale: You'll want this for income tax and to track the progress of your career, etc.. And besides, it's the most enjoyable entry to make. Date of publication: This date is critical as it determines the year of eligibility for awards for this story. 

* Date and amount of payment: Do I need to explain this? You'll need this for income tax, as you will likely adopt a cash (versus an accrual) method for reporting income from writing. You also want to track this to ensure the market has paid you.

 * rights sold (first, second, audio, etc.), word length of story, and more. I also track things like submissions, sales (numbers and dollars), and rejections in total and per year,
